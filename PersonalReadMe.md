Hello👋,
<br>I'm Benjamin Gijbels and i am a first year student @ Hogeschool PXL Digital, Hasselts, Belgium.
<br>I'm following classes to achieve a professional bachelor in applied computer science.
<br>Since i'm a almost a senior regarding age it's quite a different approach and it also needs a different kind of engagement.
<br>But since the start my interest is much increased, we see progression, even if it's not at the same speed as for younger people.
<br>So i believe input, discipline, commitment and concistency, will help achieve tha goal.
<br>
<br>👀 I’m interested in to many things...
<br>
<br>🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of new things since i have no prior knowledge in computer science. 
<br>A lot of basic things wil have to get stuck in my BrainDrive this year.
<br>  - Algorithms 🤯😵‍💫🥴 in Python
<br>  - Web essentials with HTML5 & CSS
<br>  - Essentials in networking
<br>  - Data essentials & Data advanced with SQL
<br>  - Systems essentials with Linux & Windows
<br>  - Essentials in .NET
<br>  - Essentials in Javascript
<br>  - Essentials in security
<br>Quite a pile to upload to the BrainDrive 
<br>
<br>💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things mentioned above, though i'm not experienced yet, it's the only way to learn.
<br>If i find any leftovers of time, collaborations on extra toppics is maybe a good way to broaden the knowledge and gain extra skillzzz...
<br>
